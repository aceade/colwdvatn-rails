# Cowldvatn Rails

A React practice project to get some more practice with React's [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) hook. The use case here is displaying a "shopping cart" on the navbar while the user browses a different page.

This is partly inspired by [this other project](https://aceade.github.io/sydfjords-react/) and [its original Vue version](https://aceade.github.io/sydfjords/). They're part of the same fictional universe.
